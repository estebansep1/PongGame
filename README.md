## Instructions
- To play the game, you need two players. Each player controls one paddle using the following keys:
- Player 1 (blue paddle): Use the 'W' key to move the paddle up. Use the 'S' key to move it down.
- Player 2 (red paddle): Use the up arrow key to move the paddle up. Use the down arrow key to move it down.
- Score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.
- The first player to get to 5 points will ultimately win the game.

*The ball will speed up each time it hits a paddle! Good luck!* Ball speed resets at the beginning of each round.
