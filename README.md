This is my attempt of making a game of Pong! More details to come as i finish this project.


INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Player 1 (blue paddle): Use the 'W' key to move the paddle up. Use the 'S' key to move it down.
- Player 2 (red paddle): Use the up arrow key to move the paddle up. Use the down arrow key to move it down.
- Score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.
- The first player to get to 5 points will ultimatly win the game.


*THE BALL WILL SPEED EACH TIME IT HITS A PADDLE. BALL SPEED RESETS BEGINNING OF EACH ROUND.
